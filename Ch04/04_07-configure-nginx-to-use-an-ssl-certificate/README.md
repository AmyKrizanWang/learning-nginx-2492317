# 04_07 Configure NGINX to use an SSL certificate

An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates a website's identity and helps encrypt the connection between a browser and a web server.

## Create a Self-Signed SSL Certificate
1. Check for the `openssl` command on your system

    ```BASH
    which openssl
    ```

2. Install `openssl` if needed

    ```BASH
    sudo apt install -y openssl
    ```

3. Use the following command to:
    - Create a private key
    - Create a certificate
    - Sign the certificate with the key

    ```
    openssl req -batch -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
        -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx.key \
        -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx.crt
    ```
